Firstly let me tell you that i haven't used cv2.inrange() method for color detection.

To scan sides you can use keys:
U=UP
D=DOWN
R=RIGHT
L=LEFT
F=FRONT
B=BACK

color symbols are mentioned in each center of side in preview window.

as you may see GREEN will be in CENTRE.

Once you get the solution window press any key to continue.
